I am a current Junior at Emory University majoring in Quantitative Sciences with a track in Economics. My coursework includes areas in mathematics, statistics, economics, and biology. On top of my coursework, I have self-studied areas of computer science relevant to data science. 

Outside of class, I am a member of the Varsity Cross Country and Track & Field teams for Emory, specializing in the 5K and 8K races.  On average I run around 10-12 miles daily and race every couple of weeks during the school year.  Keep up with my most recent races by clicking the "runner" icon to the left!
