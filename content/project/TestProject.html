<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>As a member of the varsity cross country and track teams at Emory, it is my goal to be as accomplished Division III runner as possible. This means not only giving it my all while training each day, but also taking care of my body and preparing myself for upcoming races. What I wanted to achieve out of this project retains to preparing myself for future races. My running goals include scoring consistently at the conference level to help Emory try to win a UAA championship, along with eventually becoming an All-American level runner. In this project I get a better grasp of what it means to achieve those goals and gives me a clearer idea of the improvements I will need to make before I can be at that level.</p>

<h1>The Dataset</h1>
<p>As a 5K runner, I wanted to collect data on NCAA Division III 5K runners. From the website TFRRS.com, I was able to collect data at the NCAA Division III and UAA levels. I chose to collect the top 8 athletes at the UAA level each year since that is what it takes to score, and the top 20 at the NCAA level because that is what it takes to be eligible to compete at the National Championship. Unfortunately, I was only able to get data dating back to the 2010 for the NCAA and 2011 for the UAA because that is when they started publishing the data online, so I will have to work with a smaller pool of data than I was hoping for. To clean the data I had to change the variable types and fix the time and date data.</p>
